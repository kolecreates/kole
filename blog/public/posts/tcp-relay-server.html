  <h2>TCP Relay Server</h2>
  <p class="meta">Posted August 3, 2024</p>

  <p>
    Just completed the first pass at writing a basic TCP relay server "Written
    in Rust"™️®. Getting Rust programs to compile has a similar feeling of doing
    a newspaper sodoku. Its been a good learning experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of this tcp relay server is to eventually act as a relay for
    replicas in a distributed pubsub cluster. Replicas that receive a message
    from client A and need to broadcast to client B that is connected to another
    replica will broadcast the message through the relay.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without the relay server, the replicas would need to connect to each other
    directly, which <i>is</i> a possible alternative btw.
