      Today i'm starting a thought diet. Here are the guidelines:

      - I can only think about computer stuff while i'm at the computer (unless I specifically get up from the computer to pace around the room over a problem)
      - Avoid simulating the past, future or possible realities
      - Focus on smells, sounds, tastes, feelings, and entities around me
      

      I'll keep this page updated (i think) as I go.

      Peace and love,

      Kole

  <p>Today I'm starting a thought diet. Here are the guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I can only think about computer stuff while I'm at the computer (unless I
      specifically get up from the computer to pace around the room over a
      problem)
    </li>
    <li>Avoid simulating the past, future or possible realities</li>
    <li>Focus on smells, sounds, tastes, feelings, and entities around me</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I'll keep this page updated (I think) as I go.</p>

  <p>
    a few days later, i'm doing ok with it. I have violated the first guideline
    several times. I give myself slack, it's a longterm lifestyle goal, not a
    fad.
