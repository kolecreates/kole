  <p>bundb makes persistence feel like normal javascript maps and arrays</p>

  <p>i've long felt there could be a more idomatic database for javascript.</p>

  <p>i.e. one that feels more like javascript and less an SQL interface</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      the bun (<a href="https://bun.sh" target="_blank">https://bun.sh</a>)
      runtime has a builtime synchronous sqlite client that is very ergonomic
      and very performant
    </li>
    <li>
      the synchronous nature of the sqlite client makes the map and array
      operations feel like their vanilla js counterpart. no
      promises/async/await/trycatch.
    </li>
    <li>
      the bun node compatability api does not yet have node:cluster (<a
        href="https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/nodejs-apis"
        target="_blank"
        >https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/nodejs-apis</a
      >). However, it's in the works
      <a href="https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/11492" target="_blank"
        >https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/11492</a
      >.
    </li>
    <li>
      as an alternative to node:cluster, one can you use bun.spawn and
      bun.serve({ reusePort: true }) to create multiple bun processes that can
      handle requests concurrently.
    </li>
    <li>
      sqlite WAL mode allows multiple concurrent readers and the writer does not
      block the readers.
    </li>
    <li>
      sqlite can be easily backed up and restored because it's a single file (2
      files if including the WAL file which is persisted on macos)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Questions:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      what are the performance/scaling characteristics? So far it seems very
      good for most low-to-medium scale applications. More on this to come.
    </li>
    <li>
      how to handle the intercept/hooks feature across multiple spawned bun
      processes? I'm not sure yet.
    </li>
  </ul>
