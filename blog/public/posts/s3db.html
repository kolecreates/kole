  <h2>S3 as a Database</h2>
  <p class="meta">Posted on August 1, 2024.</p>
  <p>
    Update on August 8, 2024: I'm thinking about
    <a href="/posts/jsolite.html">jsolite</a> instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Can S3 be used in place of a database? Should S3 be used in place of a
    database?
  </p>
  <p>
    I saw a comment on stackoverflow "s3 wasn't designed for that". Perhaps
    they're right, but this is just an excercise at this point. If it were to
    work out and actually be good for some situations - then fantastic! If it
    sucks - then I know more about databases and distributed systems.

  <h4>Notes:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Each replica of the s3db server will post a file to s3 with it's IP
      address. Each replica periodically lists the IPs, and inits a tcp
      connection to any replicas that have a lesser IP than its own. This way
      all replicas will automatically discover and connect to each other.
    </li>
    <li>
      S3 is strongly consistent but there is no native locking feature, so
      locking has to be implemented in the s3db server logic. This is probably
      going to be the greatest source of complexity and latency within the
      entire system.
    </li>
    <li>
      I have some thoughts on how locking might work, but i'll write more about
      that later.
    </li>
  </ul>
