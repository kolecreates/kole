# kscript

kscript is a domain specific scripting language for doing stuff on a knode/knet.

## Objectives

- make the world happy
- make the world healthy
- make the world powerful
- have fun

## Strategy/Philosophy

- bake as much into the language as possible so people have to make less decisions
- give people freedom by freeing them of programming they'd rather not be doing (even if they think they want to at first)
- open source for maximum accessibility, longevity, and community
- performance/efficiency matters even on fast hardware and networks. i.e. don't take hardware for granted
- the runtime implementation should be performant, secure, robust, cohesive, understood, and long lasting. Rust, minimal dependencies, documentation.
- if you can't do something with kscript it's either because you shouldn't or can't, _yet_.
